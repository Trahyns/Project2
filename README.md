# Project2
Name: Toni Rahyns

Overview:
This website is a great example of using jQuery, $.ajax, an API Key from GIPHY, and Cascading Style Sheets to create a Search Engine.
On the main page, there is a search engine inside of a form element, for the user to input what Gifs they would like to see. Once the user inputs their text, then click on the search button, the gifs (up to 25) will appear below the search bar.

User Stories: 
1.	As Toni, I want to search for a cat gif to send to a friend who loves cats!
2.	As a student, I want to find funny gifâ€™s for my project. 

Technologies Used:
.html, .css, .scss, jQuery, Ajax, Giphy API Key Creation

Ideas for future improvement:

1. Make the navbar show at the bottom of the page when screen is mobile view
2. Learn how to change themes using bootstrap
3. Learn how to clear gifs already displayed in body tag when click button is "click" and replace with new input
