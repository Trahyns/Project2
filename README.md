Overview:
This website is a great example of using jQuery, $.ajax, an API Key from GIPHY, and Cascading Style Sheets to create a Search Engine.
On the main page, there is a search engine inside of a form element, for the user to input what Gifs they would like to see. Once the user inputs their text, then click on the search button, the gifs (up to 25) will appear below the search bar.
